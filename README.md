## Code Organization

- Modularization - Separating code into specific files by functionality (CSS and JavaScript);

- CSS Architecture - Organizing styles by components and features;

- Best structuring practices - Separation of concerns between structure, style, and behavior.


## User Experience (UX)

- Accessibility - Use of ARIA attributes, proper contrast, and intuitive navigation;

- Microinteractions - Small animations and transitions that improve user experience;

- Light/Dark Theme - Implementation of theme toggling with preference persistence.


## Performance

- CSS Optimization - Efficient style organization to avoid redundancies;

- Efficient Loading - Preloading fonts and critical resources;

- Optimized Animations - Use of CSS properties that leverage hardware acceleration.


## Specific Techniques

- Clipboard Manipulation - Copy email to clipboard with visual feedback;

- Interactive Forms - Form validation and submission feedback;

- Smooth Navigation - Smooth scrolling for internal links;

- Scroll-Based Animations - Elements that animate as they enter the viewport.


## Tools and Technologies

- Version Control - Integration with GitHub for code versioning;

- External Libraries - Integration with Font Awesome for icons;

- Google Fonts - Use of custom web fonts;

- FormSubmit - Integration with form submission service without backend.
